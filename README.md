# Anime-Recommendation-System-HTML-PHP-JS
This is a website created to get and organize information on animes streamed in Crunchyroll. The languages of html, php, MySQL, JavaScript and CSS were used. Moreover, Google and Plotly graph resources were implemented to give a better insight on database trends.

In order to run this webite locally, you need to create a users table with the fields specified in the code. Furthermore, a favorites table was also created, this table includes every field the animes table does, as well as the userID.
